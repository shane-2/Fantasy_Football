    1. Do acronyms like RB and WR sound like gibberish?
  </p>
<br>
  <div *ngIf="bool1">
    <p>
      No problem, I'll explain. Running backs (RB) take handoffs directly from
      the line of scrimmage, and tend to carry the ball more often for fewer
      yards. Receivers (WR) on the other hand, usually catch the ball from the
      quarterback for more yards but with less frequency. They both have
      relatively equal value for fantasy, and will always make up in the Top 10
      spots in our rankings because you need two of each to field a roster. On
      top of that, most leagues have an added FLEX position where you can score
      an additional RB or WR. Even though Quarterbacks (QB) score the most
      points, most leagues only have one QB spot, which lessens their value due
      to something called positional scarcity. The best QB (usually Patrick
      Mahomes) will always rank lower than you would expect because of this
      property, even though he just won league MVP.

      Tips: You can use our rankings to determine which RBs and WRs have the
      most value, but also keep an eye on outliers at the QB position and the
      Tight End (TE) position (like Travis Kelce) as well. Use our Top
      Adds/Drops page to see which players are hot or not right now. If you have
      bench space and a Top Add is available in your league, consider picking
      them up!

    Are you comfortable with the basics, but wondering how to improve your team
    through trades?
  </p>
  <br />
  <p *ngIf="bool2">
    To use a basketball metaphor (because sports!), setting your lineup and
    checking the waiver wire is like mastering your dominant hand. You can
    navigate the court, make highlight plays, and get off jumpers. But learning
    how to trade is like developing the ability to finish and dribble with your
    offhand. Before long, the whole court opens up and almost any player you
    want becomes acquirable... for the right price. Your ability to make smart
    trades often depends on your knowledge of your league mates and opening
    relationships. Sometimes a failed trade offer isn't a failure at all,
    because it opens up lines of communication between two players. UNLESS you
    offer two bench RBs and a kicker for Justin Jefferson. Everybody hates that
    guy.

    Tips: Start every trade process by looking at other team's holes. You have
    two reliable TEs? Great, see who's been dropping and picking up TEs every
    week searching for an answer. From there, 2 for 1 trades are almost always
    your best friend. Package Hunter Henry with DJ Moore and see if you can go
    get a WR upgrade like Tee Higgins. Target players coming off down weeks,
    especially if they've just played a tough defense. You can check our
    Defensive Rankings v Position page for that information. On the flip side,
    be careful targeting players coming off boom weeks. Often the seller will
    want more in return than the player is actually worth. Everyone will be
    looking at their league specific rankings (ESPN, Yahoo, Sleeper) when
    evaluating trade offers. Use this to your advantage. Check our rankings to
    look for discrepancies and find an edge on the trade block.

    Are you wondering what FantasyBros has to offer in the very saturated market
    of fantasy sports?
  </p>

    Same, we're just a group of students trying to figure it out. What I do know
    is I'm sick of hearing the same old fantasy moguls run the game just because
    they entered the space at the right time. I have my personal role models
    likeÂ Andy and Jason from the Fantasy Footballers, who have shaped my views
    and passions for fantasy football. But then there's other characters (such
    as Derek Brown from that site we don't talk about) who yell dumb stats into
    a mic, victory lap every win, and run away from every bad take. But our goal
    isn't to take aim at the big boys, just to provide an alternate,
    user-sourced ranking system that's inclusive to all levels of fantasy
    players. Am I worried Jimmy G will shoot up the rankings because he's so
    hot? Yeah a little bit, but maybe that means you can offer him out to Sharon
    from the work league and get back a decent WR3.

    Have you learned from multiple sources that rostering more than two TEs is
    inefficient, but still can't shake the feeling that there's a market
    inefficiency and maybe one will break out?

    Welcome, I hope you've enjoyed our website so far. While our rankings are
    for the people, the core principles of this site's design is for you. I've
    been lucky enough to build everything we have so far with an incredible
    group of coders and instructors for the final project of our C# boot camp,
    but I intend to keep building throughout the course of this season and
    hopefully beyond. My email is zachbuth@gmail.com. Shoot me an email if you
    have any ideas on how to improve on our design, have coding experience, or
    just want to discuss fantasy football.
